Yes — Zoho Mail can restrict outbound email by domain, including limiting sending so users can only email within your own domain, but it’s not a basic client‑only button like in Microsoft 365 — you have to use Email Policies or Outgoing Rules in the Admin Console to set it up.

📌 What Zoho Mail supports

Admins can create and apply policies that restrict outgoing email based on domains:

You can define allowed domains for outgoing mail so that users can only send to your organization’s domain(s) (e.g., @yourdomain.com) and block everything else.

You can also define blocked domains for outgoing email if you want to prevent users from sending to specific external domains.

“Org domains only” can be set so that users cannot send emails outside your domain at all.

📌 Outgoing Rules

Zoho also has an Outgoing Rules feature that gives more detailed control over outgoing mail, including:

Conditions based on external recipients

Actions such as reject/send bounce‑back, quarantine, or block user if the rule matches certain criteria
(You can use this to reject emails that aren’t addressed only to your domain)

🧠 Plan Requirement

These features are available on paid Zoho Mail plans (e.g., Workplace Standard or higher) because you need access to the admin console policies and rules, which aren’t part of the free plan.

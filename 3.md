📌 What Zoho Mail supports

Admins can create and apply policies that restrict outgoing email based on domains:

You can define allowed domains for outgoing mail so that users can only send to your organization’s domain(s) (e.g., @yourdomain.com) and block everything else.

You can also define blocked domains for outgoing email if you want to prevent users from sending to specific external domains.

“Org domains only” can be set so that users cannot send emails outside your domain at all.

📌 Outgoing Rules

Zoho also has an Outgoing Rules feature that gives more detailed control over outgoing mail, including:

Conditions based on external recipients

Actions such as reject/send bounce‑back, quarantine, or block user if the rule matches certain criteria
(You can use this to reject emails that aren’t addressed only to your domain)

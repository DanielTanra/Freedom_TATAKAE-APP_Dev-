Summary:
✅ Zoho Mail can restrict sending so users can only email internal addresses (your domain) or a permitted list.
✅ It’s done using Email Policy and Outgoing Rules in the Admin Console.
❌ This isn’t available on the free email plan — you need a paid Workplace plan (like Standard) to access those admin controls.
